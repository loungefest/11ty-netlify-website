“The Colorful World of Arp Frique” is the exotic and super funky debut album of producer, musician and thinker Arp Frique. After his surprising, very well received debut release on Rush Hour, Arp Frique continues collaborating with Orlando Julius, Ed Motta, Americo Brito, Ronald Snijders and more! 

The Family members join Arp on stage around the world, having played at a range of leading festivals, like Lowlands, North Sea Jazz, Dekmantel, Womad, Transmusicales and Le Guess Who besides playing sessions for KEXP, Red Bull Music, Radio Nova and showcasing their explosive brand of psychedelic Afrocaribbean funk around Europe and Asia.
