Music that makes your worn off Allstars dance by them self, in the mosh pit they feel at their best and so do 
you. A magical mixture between garage punk and stoner rock with a feel for rhythm. BB & the Binkie Boys is 
united by their shared love for beer, music and Ivo. Formerly know as Shit Machine, they still have the same 
energy but are now rocking harder than ever. “BB & the Binkie Boys is the best band ever” – Ivo.
