There is no doubt that Sandrien is part of the reason why the Amsterdam scene is currently enjoying a moment in the spotlight. Since the nineties,\
her hard work has helped establish the city’s now worldwide reputation for techno. As a former resident at the legendary Trouw, who now holds down\
the same job at De School, she has further cemented her own position as local star turned global ambassador. 

Though still deeply entrenched in her hometown scene, Sandrien is now a welcome guest at vital clubs like Berghain, Bassiani and Fabric, and frequently tours Asian clubs like Contact and Circus. It is at these places that she joins the dots between the past and the present, with driving drums and well-structured sets that are adventurous when needed and familiar when the feeling takes her there. Her musically open mind attracts similar open minded crowds who appreciate her every move, whether that’s a sweaty set in cozy confines of the basement of De School in Amsterdam or on an enormous platform at somewhere like Awakenings, Lowlands or Loveland. 

At home, she is one of the founders of the notorious ‘Is Burning’ brand. Sandrien is also an affiliate of the vital Rush Hour empire, which takes in a\
multitude of labels, taste making record shop and parties all over the world. She was also given the honour of playing a special farewell Boiler\
Room set at Trouw shortly before it closed and was part of the outstanding Boiler Room at Skate Café, where she thrilled the crowd with her energetic\
selections, and she continues to curate her own De School nights with quality guests like Blawan, DJ Nobu and Oscar Mulero. Always evolving\
while staying true to the uncompromising roots of techno, Sandrien remains at the beating heart of both the local and international scenes.
