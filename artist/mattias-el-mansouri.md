Mattias El Mansouri is a Moroccan/Chilean DJ and producer from Skene, Sweden, now based in Stockholm. He co-founded the Ritmo Liminal club concept and has developed a distinctive sound that blends introspective rhythms with ambient textures. His music emphasizes subtlety and emotional depth, often unfolding gradually rather than demanding attention.

His discography includes collaborations like Galapagos with Dorisburg and releases on labels such as Aniara Recordings and Nous’klaer Audio. El Mansouri’s DJ sets are known for their unpredictability and genre-blending, spanning house, techno, disco, funk, and global influences. He is a resident at Stockholm’s Under Bron/Trädgården, a key venue in Sweden’s electronic music scene.

Mattias has performed at major venues and festivals, including Panorama Bar and Draaimolen (notably in a back-to-back set with Hunee). His work is marked by a hybrid approach that combines underground credibility with broad appeal, always aiming to create immersive and emotionally resonant experiences.
