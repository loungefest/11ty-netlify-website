New Orleans brass band-meets-Mardi Gras Indian outfit Cha Wa radiates the energy of
the city’s street culture. “My People,” the band’s follow up to their Grammy-nominated
album “Spyboy,” feels like pure joy, a distillation of generations of New Orleans
expression. But it also never fails to remind us how hard-won that joy was and still is:
not least in the tense, funky and explosive title track, with its declaration “My people,
we’re still here.”
“Mardi Gras Indian songs are inherently songs about freedom,” the band’s drummer Joe
Gelini says. “And that struggle is as relevant today as it’s ever been.” Popmatters
describes the band as "a grand gumbo of singing, intoxicating rhythms, and deep funk
grooves that are impossible to resist.”

"I’ve seen the future of New Orleans music and its name is Cha Wa." - Paste
“Powerful, relatable, vibrant.” - NPR All Things Considered
"Cha Wa, with bass lines played on sousaphone plus trumpet and two trombones, bring
the city's brass band tradition to bear. Add sick jazz-funk guitar, and...full-beaded
holiday regalia, and the result was a portable Mardi Gras Dance Party!" - Rolling Stone
“Cha Wa blends Mardi Gras Indian tradition and modern pop magic.” – No Depression
