Risen from the primordial ooze of Rotterdam’s dampened DIY-caverns, Smudged scramble the very fabric of krautrock, noise punk, electronic pop and techno to new kinetic heights. Their offbeat live shows structurally unfold in novel forms of madness & mayhem.


The band’s initial flurry of singles – including the Death Grips-esque “Upside Down / Inside Out”, downer post-punk anthem “Stupid” and live favorite “Hypnotize” – are the perfect blend of camp and creativity, leaving crowds both confused and amped out of their minds. Smudged seasoned their explosive sound further on their 2022 self-titled EP. Now operating at full throttle, their shows have become the stuff of legend, always devising new wacky ways to rile up crowds – only to still win them over in the end.
