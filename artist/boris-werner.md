House music scholar Boris Werner is without a doubt one of the most charismatic gures in the Amsterdam scene, and has been for over a decade. His personality, great taste in music and extraordinary mixing skills behind the decks have taken him around the world already. He loves nothing better than bringing his indestructible grooves to dance floors all over the globe. His gift has also led him to holding two very special residencies in Europe, at Trouw in Amsterdam and Circoloco on Ibiza. When Boris plays his records in a club, any club, time is no longer of importance. It seems a vague concept that you used to know, but don’t anymore. This is where Werner belongs, does what he does best: making people dance. He takes you on an endless journey from cultivated house music to that raw, underground house sound; all with an undeniable phat groove. No matter the time or place,\
Boris Werner always knows exactly what records to play.

Goes without saying Boris Werner is known as a dj pur sang. However when he does produce his own music -for renowned labels like Voyage Direct, Get Psychical and Rush Hour- it’s excellence all the way. He takes his time in the studio and chooses quality over quantity any day. If that leads to beauty's like his remix for good friend Tom Trago (Lost In The Streets Of New York) and beasts like ‘Set It Off’, surely no one will mind his strategy
