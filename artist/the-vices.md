The Vices are a high-energy rock band from Groningen, Netherlands, known for their raw, playful take on alternative rock. Formed by Floris van Luijtelaar, Simon Bleeker, Jonathan Kruizenga, and Mathijs Louwsma, the band embraces personal quirks and imperfections as creative fuel. Their explosive live shows have earned them spots at major festivals like Sziget, Pinkpop, and SXSW, and a 26-city U.S. tour showcased their global ambition.

Theyâ€™ve also launched their own festival, ViceFest, expanding it internationally after winning the Pop Stipendium prize. With a new album, Before It Might Be Gone, set for release on February 7, 2025, and recognition as a Spotify RADAR artist, The Vices are rapidly rising as a standout force in the indie rock scene.
