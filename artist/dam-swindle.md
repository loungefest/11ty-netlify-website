Dam Swindle are famously avid collectors of both old and new records, and it shows in their DJ sets,
which keep you on your toes as they move freely and skillfully through different times, places and sounds.
Rather than limiting themselves to a certain feeling or mood, Detroit Swindle can call on classic house,
obscure disco, African funk, soulful techno and plenty in between, all with the aim of making those special
moments that crowds never forget. It is for that reason that their name has become a real stamp of
authority and invention in the dance music world. Whatever they do, then, this pair do with irresistible
charm.
