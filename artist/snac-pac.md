Snac Pac is a funkadelic duo comprised of Peter “Sleazy Pete” Gomes and Kevin van Belen. Based in Amsterdam, the duo fuses bluesy vocals with afrobeats and disco rhythms to create a party ready sound. Their debut tracks “She Don’t Know Where I’m From”, “Watcha Gotta Say”, and “B.O.P” combine bumping baselines and bouncy synths to bring a groovy sound that will have anyone’s hips swaying.
