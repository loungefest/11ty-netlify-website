BSS is the alias of Amsterdam’s Luigi Vittorio Vromen, a DJ and producer known for blending 80s minimalism, electro, and modular synthesis into timeless, genre-crossing sounds. He’s performed globally, including a memorable closing set at De School’s final New Year’s Day party. With releases on Dekmantel, Hivern Discs, and his own label BSS AMS, he also creates music for fashion and delivers both DJ and live sets that push sonic boundaries with storytelling at their core.
