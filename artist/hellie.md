DJ Hellie has been an integral part of the Amsterdam DJ scene for over ten years, working front and back office with passion and ferocity. She prefers the medium of vinyl and digs most music from 1977-1982, though she’ll also delve into contemporary sounds and holds the accessibility of digital music in high regard. Her sets build a brilliant bridge between old and new music for dancing to.

Notable post-corona shows have included a packed Brighter Days at Doka and an ecstatic closing set at Blauwdruk. Here’s hoping things stay “post”, so the slice of pie Hellie is serving continues to surprise and elate.
