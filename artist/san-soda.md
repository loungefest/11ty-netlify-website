San Soda is known in underground music circles as a real record collector. It shows in his predictably unpredictable DJ sets, which are made up of carefully chosen gems unearthed after years of crate digging around the world. Based in Berlin but Belgian by birth, San Soda spends at least some time every single day searching for records, either online, in shops, at flea markets or by nosing through whole collections. Classic house and techno with a rough, Chicago and Detroit bent is his main preference, interspersed with cheerful disco, enchanting Afro or timeless electro cuts. Preferring extended sets with proper rotary mixers, he is a gimmick free selector who avoids tricks and effects. Instead he allows the music to play out as it was intended, always with an underlying sense of cohesion
